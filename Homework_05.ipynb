    "# **Week 5: Feature Selection and Regularization on the Ames Housing Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "In last week’s homework, you built and evaluated linear regression models with increasingly rich feature sets. This week, we take the next critical step: **deciding which features to keep—and how much complexity is too much**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world modeling, adding more predictors does not automatically lead to better models. Extra features can increase variance, reduce interpretability, and hurt generalization. This homework explores two complementary strategies for controlling model complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature selection**, where we explicitly choose a subset of predictors\n",
    "* **Regularization**, where we keep all predictors but constrain their influence\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will experiment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Forward Selection**\n",
    "* **Backward Selection**\n",
    "* **Ridge Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward and backward selection approach the same problem from opposite directions—one builds a model up feature by feature, while the other prunes features away—and because both are greedy algorithms, they may arrive at different solutions. In contrast, ridge regression does not discard features at all; instead, it keeps all predictors but shrinks their coefficients toward zero, reducing model complexity in a continuous rather than discrete way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing these methods highlights an important modeling choice: whether to simplify a model by selecting features explicitly or by regularizing their influence, and how these different strategies affect generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **4 problems** with **8 graded answers** worth **6 points each**, and you receive **7 points for completion**.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Copy** from the video notebook into the cell indicated below the code that runs forward feature selection and generates a plot (excluding the part that prints the test MSE--we'll do that at the end of this homework). Or write your own version!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify** this code to display the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** instead of MSE.  \n",
    "   - *Remember*: RMSE is the square root of MSE, which provides results in dollars rather than dollars squared, making the metric more interpretable.  \n",
    "   - Both the plot of RMSE vs. the number of selected features and the printout of the Best CV Score should use RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run** the code on `X_train` and `y_train` (keeping all default settings) to:\n",
    "   - Generate the plot of **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** vs. **Features Added**, and  \n",
    "   - Print the **Best Feature Set** found and the **Best CV RMSE Score**.\n",

    "## **Problem Three: Ridge Regression on the Ames Housing Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we will apply Ridge Regression to the Ames Housing dataset. Ridge Regression includes a hyperparameter $\\alpha$ that controls the strength of the regularization penalty, which helps prevent overfitting by constraining the growth of the model’s coefficients. A higher $\\alpha$ penalizes large coefficients more, while a lower $\\alpha$ allows them to grow larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the model, the parameter must be specified, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=100)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces another instance of the model selection problem: we must determine the value of $\\alpha$ that yields the best CV RMSE score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Follow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardize the Data:**  \n",
    "   Ridge regression is sensitive to the scale of the features, so we will use `StandardScaler` to standardize the feature set to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before training and testing. Note that the target variable does **not** need to be scaled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform Cross-Validation Over a Range of Alpha Values:**  \n",
    "   For each $\\alpha \\in \\{100, 110, 120, \\dots, 500\\}$, calculate the cross-validation RMSE score for the model using 5-Fold CV scoring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize the Results:**  \n",
    "   Plot the CV RMSE scores against the $\\alpha$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Identify the Best Alpha:**  \n",
